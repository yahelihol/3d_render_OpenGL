"""
Code Organization: Consider breaking down the code into more functions or classes for better readability and maintainability.
Collision Response: Ensure that the collision response accurately reflects the physical properties and interactions of the circles.
@@@ Performance: Depending on the number of circles and complexity, you might need to optimize for performance.

@@@ variable mass and radius, keep total momentum vector preserved, account for in gravity and collisions, display mass

Visual Features
### Grid Background: Add a grid to the background to better visualize panning and zooming.
### Zoom and Panning Indicators: Display current zoom level and offset values on the screen.
###(momentum?) Velocity Arrows: Draw arrows representing the velocity of each circle to visualize their movement.
### Trails with Fade: Implement fading trails so that older parts of the path slowly fade away.
Gameplay or Interaction Features
Clickable Circles: Make circles clickable, showing information (velocity, position, etc.) or allowing the user to drag them.
###(sliders for all variables) User Controls: Add buttons or key bindings to reset the view, change gravity, or modify simulation parameters.
@@@ Add/Remove Circles: Implement controls to dynamically add or remove circles in the simulation.
Physics & Simulation Enhancements
###(merge? sound? explode? particles?) Collisions: Implement collision detection between circles, making them bounce off each other or merge.
###(no) Repulsion Forces: Add a repulsion force to avoid circles clumping together.
### Adjustable Gravity: Allow the user to change the gravitational constant (G) in real time to see different behavior.
Data and Analytics
@@@ Position/Velocity Logging: Log the position, velocity, and other parameters of each circle for analysis or debugging.
@@@(clickable and editable) Circle Information Display: Show each circleâ€™s position, velocity, and other stats on the screen.
@@@ Graph of Speed/Distance: Create a graph or chart showing speed or distance over time for each circle.
Graphics and Aesthetics
@@@ Customizable Colors: Allow users to change the colors of the circles and paths.
@@@ Better Visuals: Use gradients, shading, or textures to improve the appearance of the circles and trails.
@@@ Particle Effects: Add particle effects when circles collide or as part of their trails.
Advanced Features
####(only pan) Zoom to Fit: Automatically zoom and pan to keep all circles in view.
@@@ Dynamic Camera: Implement a camera that follows a particular circle or keeps all circles in the frame.
@@@ 3D Simulation: Transition the simulation to 3D space for more complex interactions.
User Interface (UI)
@@@ Settings Menu: Add a UI with sliders to control parameters like gravity, air resistance, zoom speed, etc.
### Pause/Play Functionality: Allow the user to pause and resume the simulation.
@@@ Time Control: Implement fast-forward, rewind, or slow-motion controls.
