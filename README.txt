What this script does:
A 3D visualization of a grid using PyOpenGL and Pygame
a grid of cubes in a 3D (X by Y by Z) grid centered around the origin.
Mouse-controlled camera rotation
Keyboard-based movement and zoom
Text overlay showing system variables
3rd-person allows outside control rotating the grid, and centered onb the origin.
1st-person allows camera control from it's perspective, adjusting pitch and yaw, like a video game.
Also, other predefined shapes can be added to the scene, found in draw_3d_shapes (draw_octahedron, draw_cone, etc... in lots of colors too)
